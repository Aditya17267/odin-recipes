# Odin Recipes

## Overview

This project is a simple website for displaying recipes. It consists of an index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes an image of the dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and the steps to prepare the dish.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **`index.html`**: The main page that lists links to different recipes.
- **`recipes/`**: A directory containing individual HTML files for each recipe.
  - **`lasagna.html`**: An example recipe page (replace with actual recipe file names).
  - **`recipe2.html`**: Another recipe page.
  - **`recipe3.html`**: Yet another recipe page.

## Iterations

- **Iteration 1: Initial Structure**
  - Created the **`index.html`** file with boilerplate HTML.
  - Added an `<h1>` heading with the text **"Odin Recipes"**.

- **Iteration 2: Recipe Page**
  - Created the **`recipes`** directory.
  - Added an HTML file for a specific recipe (e.g., **`lasagna.html`**).
  - Included an `<h1>` heading with the recipeâ€™s name in the recipe file.
  - Added a link to the recipe page from the **`index.html`** file.

- **Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content**
  - Updated the recipe page to include:
    - An image of the finished dish.
    - A **"Description"** section with a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
    - An **"Ingredients"** section with an unordered list of ingredients.
    - A **"Steps"** section with an ordered list of preparation steps.

- **Iteration 4: Add More Recipes**
  - Created two additional recipe pages with the same structure.
  - Updated the **`index.html`** file to include links to all recipe pages in an unordered list.

## How to Use

1. Open **`index.html`** in a web browser to view the main page with links to recipes.
